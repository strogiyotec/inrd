# Chapter 1
I've been writing for at least two years now, but those were my blog posts related to programming. I am not a native English speaker so rereading my old posts time to time makes my furious, so many grammatical mistakes, sentences that do not make any sense. As all other developers I do track statistics on my website. I know who  my readers are and which browser they use. I spent so much time on each blog I post , and when I see only 50 users coming and spending only few minutes(which means they didn't read the whole content) it makes my anxious . Sometimes it makes my wander, should I even spend my time on it ? There is, however, one incident that helps me to stay motivated . Once I got a message in Instagram from a girl I've never met. She saw my blog in her Linkedin feed and decided to give it a try, as it happened she found it be interesting. Most of my readers are my friends whom I bet to read a blog as soon as I post one. But at that day I found a complete stranger who just sent me a single thank you note. I can't explain my , but it feels so warm inside when I know that single person dedicated her own time reading something I made.
Back then I realized, as long as even single person finds it interesting I will continue spending my time doing blogging.
