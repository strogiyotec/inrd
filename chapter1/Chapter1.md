# I've never read Don Quixote
## Chapter 1
### It started in September
I told myself back then , you have to remember the day but I don't.
It happened in September for sure cause I just started my first year in 
University, it was a weekend, probably Sunday and as all other days back then 
I didn't do much on weekends. Staying at home, watching something useless and 
planning a cleaning because your apartment has to be cleaned on weekends.
The clock was showing 12 P.M so it's almost lunch time, and suddenly I got a phone call 
from an unknown number. I usually don't respond to them ,add the number and see the caller in Whatsapp, If I can recognize a person by photo then I will call back, but back then something told me to peek it up, it was a weekend for god sake, bad people don't call you on weekends. It was a male voice, a man I once met but didn't have a chance to talk too much.After returning greetings he just told me, "'A' died this morning, fire accident in apartment,don't ask what happened, I am not sure yet, just call his parents and tell your condolences".
I said thanks, really? Well I didn't know how to respond. After hanging up I was silent. What are people supposed to feel knowing their best friend just died ? For me it was a fear , the same fear you feel at work wandering if you forgot to lock the door in your apartment when you were leaving.
Am I able to cook lunch now ? Better go and buy something out. I came back home
with the cheapest burger and fries I could find. Made some black tea, prepared a table ,and sat down with a burger in one hand. Now it came, a realization that this person is not in this world anymore. I start crying, silently so my ego can't hear it, with a wet face I only want one
thing, for my best friend to come back, a friend I haven't called for few month because I was "busy" thinking what I want from this life after my school graduation,
a friend who was 12 years older than me and gave me most valuable advices that I 
didn't understand, a friend who was here and so the world didn't seem to be
so rude and nasty place. I didn't call his parents , I didn't show up for a funeral. Neither did I visit his grave. How could I ? This guy just abandoned me in this cruel world. I didn't tell my mom or friends , none of them knew 'A'. 

I opened my eyes, it's 3 A.M .I cried for a few hours and fell asleep for
another 10. When your best friend died is a great excuse to skip university the next morning right  ? I got my shoes and went out to get some fresh air.
An emptiness filled the streets, apart from some drunk guys out there it was a 
silent and peaceful night. I was walking , thinking. There is something inherently
wrong with me. I didn't feel really comfortable with my friends, neither 
could I easily make some. A world felt like a new school for a kid where everybody already knows each other and made small groups based on general interests and here you are with no clue how to join any but you really want to otherwise you will be considered as weird.
In a world like this 'A' made a difference, a guy who despite an age difference
treated me as an equal. I was so proud of it, 15 years old boy who can discuss world problems with a mature adult, isn't it what everybody wants? It was for me.
Don't get it wrong,the next few months felt terrible, I was a sad ass , I blamed this world. I got every bad thing 
I saw around me and took it as personal as I could. This world would be a better
place without me isn't it ? 
Three years have passed. I was sitting in a restaurant with a best friend,
a friend who deserves a separate chapter here but for now just think about him as a best friend of mine.
We were having a conversation. He had a bad time in his relationship with a girl he has been dating for a few years. People who couldn't understand each other and try to make you something they want always ends up being a bad thing or at least that's how I felt listening to his story. He stopped talking about his emotional condition waiting for me to give him advice(maybe it was just a silence that I interrupted with my stupid story, you never know),it's time to tell him, and so I told a story about 'A' to show how fucked up and beautiful this world can be, more precisely, what happened to him three years ago and who was this guy to me. I don't really
know why I did it, maybe it was an example that you have to love people around you
because you never know what tomorrow will bring.After I finished my story ,he told me "I'm sorry for your loss". Thanks, but you shouldn't be, instead of being upset I have to thank fate for giving me a chance to know 'A', that's what I said pretending to sound cool without thinking about the meaning of these words I just said. I think I got them now.
The glass is half full , life gives and gets back, we all gonna die eventually. People break up because they don't have anything in common. I think they are wrong,
we all have something in common, we are mortal, we only learn from our mistakes
that could cost us our lives and we will be a powder flying around the world in 200 years or less from now. Isn't it enough to understand ,we are the same.

'A' once told me "Don't judge things you barely understand" at that time it was 
something related to education. These words pop up in my head recently. Watching one of the youtubers talking about his favorite books, he put "Don Quixote" as a favorite one, the book I know just because I saw the title somewhere. If your favorite youtuber tells you it's a great book , then it must be good at least.
 However, after a while , watching one of "Joe Roggan" podcasts ,the guest who happened to be a famous writer said "it's a childish book which can't be taken seriously". And here I am , occupied with thoughts about this ancient book. Single book, two different opinions, and me who made up my own just because people I never met told me so. 'A' was right, I do like judging things I don't understand.
 
I've never read Don Quixote. This is the story of me. The story of how I see this 
world and how ambiguous my opinions could be. Story I desperately want to share with this world. Before I die and become an ashes I hope to finish it. I hope my soul being "**Over the Garden Wall**" would see a single person who decided to dedicate his/her time reading this book and will take something from it. The world is a better place when we help each other, so I hope, I really hope this story can help someone,the same way as it helped me.
