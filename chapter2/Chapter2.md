## Chapter 2
The death of 'A' made me realize, I want people to know my story, I want to be heard. There is nothing special there but I believe my life wasn't ordinal. It took me a while to come up with an idea on how to start a book, there are so many thoughts going through my head that sometimes I wander , isn't it an addiction ? Once I was reading a book by  Anne Lamott "Bird by Bird" where she explains how to be a writer. On the first Chapter she left a passage, If you don't know where to start, start from your childhood. So as John Lennon said 'Let it be'.

### Childhood
I was born in 1997, in Post USSR country called Kazakhstan. You probably never heard of it , or if you did I bet it's because of this movie that recently got a sequel. My mother was 21 when she gave me a birth, for 24 years old me it sounds weird, I can't imagine being someone's father knowing whom I was at my early twenties.
She was an educated woman who enjoyed math and physics and used to be one the best students in whole university.She is however graduated during tough times when economy was poor and people struggled to find any jobs. My father was somehow different, he wasn't really interested in siting on a chair and studying complicated math formulas, but he was a cunning person who knew people's psychology , so if some subjects were hard to pass through , he would just talk to teacher and they will let him pass(I still don't understand how he did it).
