## Chapter 3 Back to School

If I know anything about me, then it's a fact that I don't like surprises. At school, I was sitting at the same place for all 11 years with one guy for first 7 and then with another one last 3 years(I had a new class at 8th year so my partners changed frequently).
Let's start with first 7 years. First of all, keep in mind I was the quitest person there.
Other kids made fun of it. I want to tell them I didn't give a shit about opinions of those around me, but I actually did. I hearts and it hears a lot. Back then I told myself, there is somithing wrong with you so all those kids make fun of you. There was however one kid that didn't care. Let's call him 'M'. 'M' was a person whose personality is better described by word 'Emo'. He didn't care about others, school and was really good at making arts. Same as me, he still had good grades , but when it took me hours to prepare for quizes and homeworks, he ,at the same time didn't do anthing. He was able to memorize everything teachers talk about in the class and just repeat it during exams. I think we found each others, two weirdos. His parents weren't rich enough so he wasn't given any money for lunch, my mother , however always told me, if you need money just get it from my pocket.
I am still pround that the only reason I used them is for food that I shared with my friend(Now when I am thing about it , god I was more aware about managing money in my early childhood than some teenegers nowadays). So we would always enjoy some cheap fast food from the cook shop together. Apart from him I didn't talk to anyone, all other kids were way cruel , I didn't understand why so it was disgusting for me to be surrounded by these people.

Apart from 'M', I had few friends from my neigboorhood. 'M' was emo and didn't like to play. My neighboors on the other hands were the bravest herous with huge imagination. I still remember, we would invite a game, choose herous, split abilities and imagine fighiting  bad guys all over the street. We could do it for hours. Just for you to understand, we were around 12 and we still enjoyed it. Other kids on the area made fun of us because at that age you were supposed to play football(which we also did but having super powers like ability to freeze your oponent with cooldown of 30 seconds). But at that time I can tell for sure, we didn't gave a damp shit, we just played.

When I was 6 years old, me and my best friend from a neighboor house tried to get some change from parents and spend then in computer clubs where you were allowed to rent a PC for as much hours as you can afford. Me and my friend would join our PC's using LAN and would play Warcraft 3. I still think it was the greatest strategy human being's ever made.

At age 7 my father bought me a PC. Pentium 4 with 1 Gig of Ram. It was able to handle all the games available in the market. I spend whole week playing all preinstalled games there, but there was something different, emotions were not the same. When you play with your buddies and share emotions or discuss a strategy to win auto generated enemies, you can't get the same experience playing by your own. And so I kept going to clubs with my friend.
