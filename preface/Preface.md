# I've never read Don Quixote
## Chapter 1
### It started in September
I told myself back then , you have to remember the day but I don't.
It happened in September for sure because I just started my first year in 
University, it was a weekend, probably Sunday and as all other days back then 
I didn't have much to do on weekends. Staying at home, watching something on Youtube and 
planning to start cleaning because your apartment has to be cleaned on weekends.
The clock was showing 12 P.M so it's almost lunch time, and suddenly I got a phone call 
from an unknown number. I usually don't respond to them ,add the number and see the caller in Whatsapp, If I can recognize a person by photo then I will call back, but back then something told me to peek it up, it was a weekend for god sake, bad people have other things to do on their free time. It was a male's voice, a man I once met but didn't have a chance to talk too much.After returning greetings he told a news, a news that I still don't understand how to react to.
I said thanks, really? Well I didn't know how to respond. After hanging up I was silent. What are people supposed to feel in such situations ? For me it was a fear , the same fear you feel at work wandering if you forgot to lock the door in your apartment when you were leaving.
Am I able to cook lunch now ? Better go and buy something out. I came back home
with the cheapest burger and fries I could find. Made some black tea, prepared a table ,and sat down with a burger in one hand. Now it came, a realization. I start crying, silently so my ego can't hear it, with a wet face I only want one
thing, for my best friend to come back, a friend I haven't called for few month because I was "busy" thinking about what I want from this life after my school graduation,
a friend who was 12 years older than me and gave me most valuable advice that I 
didn't understand, a friend who was here and so the world didn't seem to be
so rude and nasty place. I didn't call his parents , I didn't show up for a funeral. Neither did I visit his grave. How could I ? This guy just abandoned me in this cruel world. I didn't tell my mom or friends , none of them knew 'A'. 

I opened my eyes, it's 3 A.M .I cried for a few hours and fell asleep for
another 10. When your best friend died is a great excuse to skip university the next morning right  ? I got my shoes and went out to get some fresh air.
An emptiness filled the streets, apart from some drunk guys out there it was a 
silent and peaceful night. I was walking , thinking. I didn't feel really comfortable with my friends, neither could I easily make some. A world felt like a new school for a kid where everybody knows each other and have small groups based on general interests and here you are with no clue how to join any but you really want to.
In a world like this 'A' made a difference, a guy who despite an age difference
treated me as an equal. I was so proud of it, 15 years old boy who can discuss world problems with a mature adult, isn't it what everybody wants? It was for me.
 
'A' once told me "Don't judge things you barely understand" at that time it was 
something related to education. These words pop up in my head recently. Watching one of the youtubers talking about his favorite books, he put "Don Quixote" as number one, the book I know just because I saw the title somewhere. If your favorite youtuber tells you it's a great book , then it must be good at least.
 However, after a while , watching one of Joe Roggan podcasts ,the guest who happened to be a famous writer said "it's a childish book which can't be taken seriously". And here I am , occupied with thoughts about this ancient book. Single book, two different opinions, and me who made up my own just because people I never met told me so. 'A' was right, I do judge things I don't understand.
 
I've never read Don Quixote. This is the story of me. The story of how I see this 
world and how ambiguous my opinions could be. Story I desperately want to share with this world. Before I die and become an ashes I hope it will be finished. I hope my soul being Over the Garden Wall would see a single person who decided to dedicate his/her time reading this book and will take something from it. The world is a better place when we help each other, so I hope, I really hope this story can help someone,the same way as it helped me.
